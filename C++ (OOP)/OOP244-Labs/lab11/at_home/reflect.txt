1-Explain why templates should exist entirely in header files and NOT *.cpp files.

     They need to be visible for the compiler when they are instantiated. 
     That basically means that if you are publishing the template in a header, 
     the definitions have to be visible by all translation units that include 
     that header if you depend on implicit instantiation.
     The compiler generates the implementation for each client type at compile-time 
     from the template defined by the developer.


2-Name different types of polymorphism and show an example for each of the types from this workshop.
