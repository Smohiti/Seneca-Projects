1) 
The allocateAndCopy function checks the validation of three parameters : (area, number, type)    
if area and number are valid ,so it will copy them to our class's private members and then delete the not null member(type_)to allocate a new memory, 
and copy the function parameter(type) to new member (type_).

2)     
the copy-construct cant release the memory and deallocation for the resources which is assosiated with current object, due to the object is set to empty. 
when we need to deallocate any previously allocated memory that associated with the current object ,we use The assignment operator ,
so this process will prevent the memory leak.
