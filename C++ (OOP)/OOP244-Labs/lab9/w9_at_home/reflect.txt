1-Explain what virtual functions are.

     Virtual function is the member function of a base class that can be overriden in its derived class.
     A virtual function makes its class a polymorphic base class.
     It is declared with virtual keyword. Virtual function call is resolved at run-time.

2-What is the difference between virtual and pure virtual?

     For virtual function we need to provide implementation in the base class. 
     However derived class can override this implementation with its own implementation. 
     Normally , for pure virtual functions implementation is not provided. 
     We can make a function pure virtual with =0 at the end of function declaration. 
     Also, a class containing a pure virtual function is abstract, we can not create an object of this class.

3-What are abstract classes and interfaces?

     A) Abstract classes
        These are base classes where we have to derive from them and then implement the pure virtual function
        These classes are contain at least one pure virtual function.
        Veihcle class in out workshop is an Abstract

     B) Interfaces
        an interface is an abstract base class with no data members.
