1-Why was it not necessary to create an isEmpty() member function? 
A))because already we have it in bce class and we can reuse it with derived class.

2-What privacy access level did you set for your strength member attribute?
A))the data member of strength is set to private level , for that reason is not accessable by derived class.

3-How would you modify your solution to make the strength member attribute private?
A))just need to change the the base access type from public to private:
class SuperHero : private Hero

4-How would your solution need to be modified in order for the SuperHero::display member function object to 
display the deceased SuperHero’s name?  For example, the function would be modified to print “(name) the 
deceased superhero!”  Explain in plain English.
A))by changing the strength to 0 in the compare function and then change the isEmpty function to check the value of strength.
after that we modify the display function by adding the name_ before deceased superhero!.

5-View line 43 in w8_at_home.cpp file. Why does this compile?  Uncomment lines 47–48. Does it compile now? Explain why or why not?
A))dosent work, because it only know the base class and its members .the SuperHero is not the base class so its unknown for compiler.
