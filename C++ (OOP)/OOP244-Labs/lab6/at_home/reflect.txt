        by defining an accessor inside the class we can avoid the friend function and have it as a helper function outside of the class.
        Otherwise compiling prossess will fail and it shows the member is inaccessable.
	

2.	Could the first helper operator+ (which accepts Accounts as left and right operands) implemented as a member operator? 

	as long as operator function has 2 parameters we cant use it inside class as a member and shoud be declare outside of class as a helper, 
	because the left operand inside class well known as current object.
	but if we want to implement it as a member function we have to remove left operand and move the function inside class like this:
	Account& operator + ( const Account& object)

3.	In this line of your main function:
  	A = B += C += 100.01;
	the under lined operator+= that accepts a double as right operand is never defined. Explain how is it, that the code compiles and runs correctly?

	we have constructor function inside cpp file that convert the value ant take it into the operator function
