# CBC-News-Feeds
Demonstration of XML parsing.

This project is to read news feed from http://www.cbc.ca/cmlink/rss-topstories link and received the XML data, following that parsed
that data and displayed information like authorname, title, date created and image thumbnanil. On each click of the story you will be
redirected to the detailed story page and that has been taken care by using android webview with action bar title holding author's name.

Library has been used to apply nice slide left animation on the stories recycler view.

No internet scenario has been taken care of on both the pages.

Used progress dialogs also in case of slow internet.
